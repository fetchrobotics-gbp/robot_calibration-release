ros-kinetic-robot-calibration (0.6.0-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * install our new tools
  * add depend on visualization_msgs
  * Merge pull request #63 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/63> from mikeferguson/checkerboards_that_work
    Make checkerboards actually generic
  * Merge pull request #62 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/62> from mikeferguson/chain_manager_state_fix
    make sure we get valid joint_states
  * make sure we get valid joint_states
    * invalid old state, wait for new message
    * fixes #61 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/61>
  * Merge pull request #59 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/59> from saurabhbansal90/master
    Update led_finder.cpp
  * Update led_finder.cpp
  * additional tests on camera_info
  * fix build in kinetic
  * remove entirely unused data functions header
  * fix corrupted license file
  * additional warning not previously flagged
  * buildfarm is really picky, fix another signed comparison
  * fix signed comparison warning in tests
  * add tool to visualize bagfile
  * break out load_bag function for reuse
  * towards working checkerboards
    * unhack the checkerboard finder, so that points are in x/y only
    * add free_frames_initial_values parameter for setting initial
    offset of checkerboard frame
  * Merge pull request #52 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/52> from mikeferguson/melodic-backport
    backport changes from melodic-devel branch
  * fix OutrageousError
    This has apparently NEVER worked. The name that was being
    provided was the error block name, not the name of the
    parameter to limit.
  * add to_rpy tool
    The YAML file output by calibration represents angles in
    the internal axis-magnitude notation. RPY tends to be
    easier for people to understand and visualize.
  * add some comments to Camera3dModel
    In particular, a search for checkerboard should really turn up this
    important piece of code
  * fix test build/warning issues on 18.04
  * Merge pull request #50 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/50> from guilhermelawless/tf-buffer-member
    Make TF buffer a class member
  * make TF buffer a class member
    Fixes #48 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/48>. Sleeping to wait for TFs is no longer needed and was removed.
  * Merge pull request #47 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/47> from guilhermelawless/fix-checkerboard-visualization
    Fix checkerboard visualization
  * Merge pull request #45 <https://github.com/mikeferguson/robot_calibration/issues/45> from guilhermelawless/kinetic-devel
    Allow some time to get TFs in plane_finder
  * fix checkerboard visualization msg
  * allow some time to get TFs in plane_finder
  * add a second error block test, that actually needs to converge
  * fix parameter name in test, fork a second copy
  * make sure solver ran in test
  * fix cmake errors reported by buildfarm, update maintainer email
  * attempt to fix test on kinetic
  * clean up parameter loading, output printing, README
  * convert camera_to_camera into plane_to_plane
  * convert ground_plane_error into chain3d_to_plane_error
  * convert camera3d_to_arm into chain3d_to_chain3d
  * add param/residual checks to error block test
  * merge GroundPlaneFinder into PlaneFinder
  * make feature finders plugin-based, add tests
